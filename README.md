# ipl-win-predictor
I have made an End to End ML project where we will predict the winning probability in percentage of both the teams playing.

At first this seems to be a regression problem but actually we will be using classification models to do that since we 
have certain ML classification models that also tells you the probability of the output predicted.

Now all the datils of the code and project has been mentioned in my medium blog so do give it a check
